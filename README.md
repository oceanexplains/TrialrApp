 App to search the ClinicalTrials.gov database easily and open access to life-changing health interventions

Trialr App

The Trialr App is a simple iOS application that allows users to search for relevant clinical trials using the ClinicalTrials.gov API. The app provides a main screen where users can see their saved studies, a screen for when they click on a study which shows them details about the study, a search screen where they can toggle the search criteria, and a results screen where they see the results of the search as a list of studies.

The app is built entirely using SwiftUI, and uses the Codable protocol to parse the JSON response from the ClinicalTrials.gov API. The app allows users to search for clinical trials by specifying various criteria, including condition, location, and study type.

This project aims to make lifechanging health interventions more accessible by introducing people to opportunities that they might otherwise never hear of.

Getting Started

To use the Trialr App, you will need an iOS device running iOS 14 or later, or an iOS simulator running in Xcode 12 or later. You will also need an internet connection to search for clinical trials.

To get started, simply clone the project to your local machine and open the TrialrApp.xcodeproj file in Xcode. You can then run the app on a simulator or on your iOS device.

Using the App

When you first launch the app, you will be presented with the main screen, which shows a list of your saved studies. You can add studies to your saved list by clicking on the "Save Study" button on the study detail screen.

To search for clinical trials, click on the "Search" button in the navigation bar to go to the search screen. Here, you can specify various search criteria, including condition, location, and study type. Once you have specified your search criteria, click on the "Search" button to see a list of studies that match your criteria.


The results screen displays a list of studies that match your search criteria. Clicking on a study in the list will take you to the study detail screen, where you can view more information about the study.
